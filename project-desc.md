# Project Genesis
Project originated from idea from 1 specific need/functionality that can stand alone.  The idea is a focused cash flow management tool that enables families living check to check, schedule payments to align with and can be attributed directly to a specific income event (Pay check, direct deposit, etc).  Example: paycheck is scheduled for August 1st for $1000.  Users schedule a $500 bill due on or after the 1st, and attributes it to the specific paycheck.  The system tracks and lets the user know there is $500 remaining from this income event still available for other bills.  This resembles in some ways "envelope stuffing" budget planning.  This will be adapted to include ability to set up Needs/Wants/Savings budget plans, i.e. 50%/20%/30%.  Based on these budget allocations, income event available cash would be split according to the reatio. the user will be able to create and schedule bills/payments (One time, recurring, and variable), schedule income events.  Dynamic calendar view showing income and scheduled payment amounts by date. CLICKING ON DAY/WEEK/MONTH ALLOWS USER TO DRILL INTO DETAILS IN A TABULAR VIEW.  Running totals/balances for income and scheduled payment are persistently available in UI, responsive to current date context.

This functionality would be initial MVP, later integrated with complete suite of family finance functionality and tools.
