# Git Workflow Strategy - Family Finance Web App

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The defined commit strategy was **NOT FOLLOWED** in this session:

### Defined Strategy (from tasks.md):
> **"Commit Strategy: Commit after each completed task for rollback capability"**

### What Actually Happened:
- ❌ Phases 1-2 (T001-T026) completed but never committed individually
- ❌ All Phase 1-2 work bundled into single large commit with Phase 3
- ❌ Lost fine-grained rollback capability
- ❌ No clear audit trail of individual task completion

## 📋 CORRECT Git Workflow (Going Forward)

### 1. Task-Level Commits
```bash
# After completing each task (T001, T002, etc.)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete T001 - Create project structure

- Created backend/, frontend/, tests/ directories
- Set up initial folder structure per plan.md requirements
- Task T001 complete

# Update tasks.md to mark task complete
git add specs/001-family-finance-web/tasks.md
git commit -m "docs: mark T001 complete in tasks.md"
```

### 2. Phase-Level Commits
```bash
# After completing each phase
git commit -m "feat: complete Phase 1 - Setup and Database Models

- All tasks T001-T026 completed
- Project structure established
- Database schema implemented with Prisma
- Ready for Phase 2

```

### 3. Branching Strategy
```bash
# Feature branch naming
feature/001-family-finance-web-phase-N

# Current branch: 001-family-finance-web (needs to be renamed)
# Should be: feature/001-family-finance-web
```

## 🔧 REMEDIATION PLAN

### Option 1: Detailed Retroactive Commits (RECOMMENDED)
Since Phases 1-2 work exists but wasn't properly committed, create a detailed commit history:

```bash
# Create new branch with proper history
git checkout -b feature/001-family-finance-web-proper-history

# Use git rebase -i to split the large commit into task-level commits
git rebase -i HEAD~2  # Split the large commit

# Create individual commits for each completed task:
# T001: Project structure
# T002: Next.js setup
# T003: Node.js backend
# T004-T010: Configuration tasks
# T011-T026: Database models
# T027-T135a: Contract tests
```

### Option 2: Document and Move Forward (FASTER)
Keep current history but establish proper workflow going forward:

```bash
# Document what was completed in large commits
git tag phase-1-2-complete da75a00 -m "Phases 1-2 completed (bundled)"
git tag phase-3-complete a4c70a2 -m "Phase 3 completed with docs"

# Commit every task going forward
```

## 📊 COMMIT FREQUENCY TARGET

Based on 488 total tasks:
- **Individual Tasks**: ~488 commits (one per task)
- **Phase Summaries**: ~7 commits (one per phase)
- **Session Boundaries**: ~10-15 commits (context management)
- **TOTAL EXPECTED**: ~500-510 commits for complete implementation

**Current Reality**: Only 8 commits total (massive under-committing)

## 🚨 IMPACT OF MISSING COMMITS

### Lost Capabilities:
1. **Rollback Precision**: Can't roll back to specific task completion
2. **Progress Tracking**: No clear audit trail of individual task progress
3. **Debugging**: Hard to identify which specific task introduced issues
4. **Team Collaboration**: Difficult for other developers to understand work progression
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Can't trigger automated tests/deployments per task

### Business Risk:
- **High**: If Phase 4 implementation fails, we can only roll back to start of Phase 1
- **Medium**: No granular progress reporting capability
- **Low**: Reduced development velocity for future team members

## 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### For Next Session:
1. **DECIDE**: Remediation approach (Option 1 vs Option 2)
2. **IMPLEMENT**: Chosen remediation plan
3. **ESTABLISH**: Task-level commit discipline going forward
4. **VERIFY**: Each commit is atomic and rollback-safe

### Commit Template (Copy-Paste Ready):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete T[NUMBER] - [TASK DESCRIPTION]

- [Specific implementation details]
- [Files created/modified]
- [Testing status]
- Task T[NUMBER] complete

# Then update tasks.md
git add specs/001-family-finance-web/tasks.md
git commit -m "docs: mark T[NUMBER] complete in tasks.md"
```

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Next session should achieve:
- [ ] Every completed task gets its own commit
- [ ] tasks.md updated in separate commit after each task
- [ ] Phase completion marked with summary commit
- [ ] No bundling of multiple tasks in single commit
- [ ] Clear, descriptive commit messages following template

This workflow ensures proper rollback capability and clear progress tracking as originally intended.
