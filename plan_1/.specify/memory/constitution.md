# Spec Kit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-First Development
Every feature begins with a clear, testable specification that defines WHAT users need and WHY,
without implementation details. Specifications must be written for business stakeholders, mark
all ambiguities with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION], and be measurable. This ensures alignment before
coding begins and prevents scope creep.

### II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Tests MUST be written before implementation. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is mandatory:
1. Write tests that fail (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor for quality (Refactor)

Contract tests, integration tests, and unit tests follow this order. No implementation
begins until tests are failing.

### III. Constitutional Compliance
All development practices must align with this constitution. Every planning phase includes
constitution checks as gates. Violations require explicit justification in Complexity Tracking
with simpler alternatives documented. The constitution supersedes all other practices.

### IV. Phased Execution
Development follows strict phases that cannot be skipped:
- Phase 0: Research (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
- Phase 1: Design (contracts, data models, test scenarios)
- Phase 2: Task Planning (ordered, parallelizable where possible)
- Phase 3: Implementation (following TDD)
- Phase 4: Validation (all tests pass, quickstart works)

Each phase has completion gates before proceeding.

### V. Clarity & Simplicity
Start simple, avoid premature optimization. Every added complexity must solve a current,
not future, problem. Use clear naming, avoid vague language, mark uncertainties explicitly.
YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles apply throughout.

## Development Process

### Specification Standards
- Specifications focus on user needs, not technical implementation
- All requirements must be testable and unambiguous
- Edge cases and error scenarios must be documented
- Success criteria must be measurable

### Testing Discipline
- Contract tests for all API endpoints
- Integration tests for user stories
- Unit tests for business logic
- Performance tests for defined targets
- All tests must exist and fail before implementation

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality Gates
- All linting and type checking must pass
- No duplicated code without justification
- Documentation for public interfaces
- Structured logging for debugging

### Review Requirements
- Constitution compliance verification on all changes
- Test coverage for new functionality
- Performance impact assessment
- Security review for data handling

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Constitutional amendments require:
1. Written proposal with rationale
2. Impact assessment on existing practices
3. Migration plan for affected code
4. Team consensus or designated approver
5. Version increment following semantic versioning

### Versioning Policy
- MAJOR: Removing principles or backward-incompatible changes
- MINOR: Adding principles or sections
- PATCH: Clarifications and non-semantic improvements

### Compliance Review
- All pull requests verify constitutional alignment
- Planning documents include constitution check sections
- Complexity tracking documents any justified violations
- Regular audits ensure continued compliance
