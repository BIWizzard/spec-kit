# Spec-Kit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence
Every line of code must meet the highest standards of clarity, maintainability, and correctness. Code quality is non-negotiable and forms the foundation of all technical decisions. This includes:
- Clean, self-documenting code with clear intent
- Consistent formatting and style across the entire codebase
- Modular design with single responsibility principle
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- Zero tolerance for code smells and technical debt accumulation

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces maintenance costs, prevents bugs, and enables faster feature development. Poor code quality compounds exponentially over time.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Testing is not optional - it drives development. All features must follow strict TDD methodology:
- Write tests FIRST, get user approval, verify tests fail, then implement
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle must be strictly enforced
- Minimum 80% code coverage with meaningful tests (not just line coverage)
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for all service boundaries
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance tests for all performance-critical paths

**Rationale**: TDD ensures code correctness, prevents regressions, and serves as living documentation. Tests written after implementation often miss edge cases and become maintenance burdens.

### III. User Experience Consistency
Every user interaction must be predictable, intuitive, and consistent across all touchpoints:
- Uniform interaction patterns throughout the application
- Consistent visual language and component behavior
- Standardized error messaging and feedback mechanisms
- Accessibility-first design (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum)
- Response time consistency - similar operations must have similar performance
- Progressive disclosure of complexity - simple tasks stay simple

**Rationale**: Inconsistent UX increases cognitive load, reduces user satisfaction, and increases support burden. Consistency builds trust and reduces learning curves.

### IV. Performance First Architecture
Performance is a feature, not an afterthought. All implementations must consider performance implications:
- Sub-100ms response time for user interactions (p95)
- Sub-1s page load time on 3G connections
- Resource usage must scale linearly or better with load
- Memory leaks are critical bugs requiring immediate fixes
- Database queries must use indexes and avoid N+1 patterns
- Frontend bundle size must stay under 200KB gzipped for initial load

**Rationale**: Poor performance directly impacts user experience and business metrics. Performance problems are exponentially harder to fix after implementation.

### V. Parallel Multi-Agent Orchestration
Leverage parallel execution and specialized agents when complexity justifies the coordination overhead:
- Use parallel agents for independent subtasks that can execute concurrently
- Deploy specialized agents for domain-specific expertise (security, performance, UX)
- Orchestration complexity must be justified by measurable gains in:
  - Time efficiency (>30% reduction in execution time)
  - Quality improvements (specialized expertise producing superior results)
  - Risk mitigation (parallel validation reducing error rates)
- Agent communication must use well-defined contracts and interfaces
- Fallback to sequential execution when parallel benefits don't justify complexity

**Rationale**: Parallel orchestration can dramatically improve efficiency but adds coordination complexity. Use only when benefits clearly outweigh the added complexity.

## Operational Standards

### Monitoring and Observability
- Structured logging required for all services
- Distributed tracing for all cross-service calls
- Business metrics must be tracked and dashboarded
- Alert thresholds must be based on user impact, not technical metrics
- All errors must include actionable context for debugging

### Security Requirements
- Security by design - threat modeling before implementation
- All inputs must be validated and sanitized
- Authentication and authorization must use industry standards
- Secrets must never be logged or committed to version control
- Regular dependency updates with security patch SLA of 48 hours

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements
- All code requires review by at least one other developer
- Reviews must verify constitutional compliance
- Performance implications must be explicitly considered
- Test coverage and quality must be validated
- Breaking changes require explicit approval and migration plan

### Quality Gates
- CI/CD pipeline must enforce all constitutional principles
- Automated checks for code quality, test coverage, and performance
- Manual review required for architectural changes
- Production deployments require passing all quality gates
- Rollback capability required for all production changes

## Governance

The Constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. It serves as the ultimate arbiter for technical decisions and implementation standards.

### Amendment Process
1. Proposed amendments must include:
   - Clear problem statement and rationale
   - Impact analysis on existing code and processes
   - Migration plan for existing violations
   - Review by technical leadership
2. Major amendments (removing/redefining principles) require team consensus
3. Minor amendments (additions/expansions) require technical lead approval
4. All amendments must be versioned and documented

### Versioning Policy
- MAJOR version: Backward-incompatible principle changes or removals
- MINOR version: New principles or significant expansions
- PATCH version: Clarifications, wording improvements, typo fixes

### Compliance and Enforcement
- All pull requests must include constitution compliance checklist
- Violations must be documented with justification and remediation plan
- Repeated violations trigger mandatory team review
- Constitutional principles must be considered in all technical decisions
- Complexity additions must be justified against expected benefits

### Runtime Guidance
Use `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for feature planning with constitutional gates. All technical decisions must reference relevant constitutional principles. When principles conflict, prioritize based on user impact and long-term maintainability.
