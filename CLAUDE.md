# spec-kit Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-01-24

## 🚨 CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT 🚨
**NON-NEGOTIABLE**: After completing ANY task implementation:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** run `git add` and `git commit` with detailed message
2. **IMMEDIATELY** update tasks.md marking task as [x] completed
3. **IMMEDIATELY** commit the tasks.md update
4. **THEN AND ONLY THEN** start next task

### ⚠️ VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES ⚠️
**ANY DEVIATION FROM THIS WORKFLOW RESULTS IN IMMEDIATE SESSION TERMINATION**

**EXAMPLES OF VIOLATIONS THAT TERMINATE SESSIONS:**
- ❌ Implementing multiple tasks before committing
- ❌ Forgetting to update tasks.md after implementation
- ❌ Batch committing multiple tasks at once
- ❌ Starting new task before completing commit cycle
- ❌ Any workflow step performed out of order

**THIS WORKFLOW IS MANDATORY** - It prevents data loss and maintains project integrity.
