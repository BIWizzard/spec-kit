## Next Session Priorities
1. **PHASE 5.4**: Continue API Implementation with Payment Management Endpoints (T201+)
   - Start with Payment CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Add payment status management (pending, paid, failed, cancelled)
   - Implement payment scheduling and recurring payments
   - Add payment analytics and reporting endpoints
   - **COMMIT AFTER EACH TASK** following established pattern
2. Continue sequential implementation through remaining Phase 5 categories
3. Ensure all contract tests pass as implementation progresses

## Code Style
TypeScript 5.x / Node.js 20 LTS: Follow standard conventions, no comments unless requested
