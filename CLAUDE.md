## Commands
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run lint` - Run linting
- `npx jest tests/contract/test_*.ts --testMatch="**/test_*.ts"` - Run contract tests
- `npx ts-node tests/scripts/verify_tdd.ts` - Verify TDD compliance

## Implementation Status (001-family-finance-web)
- **Phase 1-2: Setup & Database Models** ✅ COMPLETE (T001-T026)
- **Phase 3: API Contract Tests** ✅ COMPLETE (T027-T135a) - 8 major contract tests written and verified failing per TDD
- **Phase 4: Service Layer** 🚧 IN PROGRESS (T145-T161) - Next: Implement core services
- **Phase 5: API Implementation** ⏳ PENDING (T162-T278)
- **Phase 6: Frontend Implementation** ⏳ PENDING (T297-T415)
- **Phase 7: Integration & Polish** ⏳ PENDING (T416-T475)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Git Workflow Issue Must Be Fixed First

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Address git workflow violation before continuing implementation.

## Next Session Priorities
1. **CRITICAL PRIORITY**: Fix git workflow (read GIT_WORKFLOW.md)
   - Choose remediation approach for missing Phase 1-2 commits
   - Establish task-level commit discipline
   - Commit after every single task going forward
2. **AFTER GIT FIX**: Implement core services in Phase 4 (T145-T161)
   - Start with: UserService, FamilyService, IncomeService, PaymentService
   - All services should use Prisma client and follow established patterns
   - **COMMIT AFTER EACH TASK** (T145, then commit; T146, then commit; etc.)
3. After services complete: Implement API endpoints in Phase 5
4. Ensure all contract tests pass as implementation progresses

## Code Style
TypeScript 5.x / Node.js 20 LTS: Follow standard conventions, no comments unless requested

## Recent Changes
- Phase 3 TDD contract tests implemented and verified failing
- Database schema complete with all models and relationships
- Test infrastructure established with Jest + supertest + Prisma
- Ready for service layer implementation
