# spec-kit Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-01-24

## 🚨 CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT 🚨
**NON-NEGOTIABLE**: After completing ANY task implementation:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** run `git add` and `git commit` with detailed message
2. **IMMEDIATELY** update tasks.md marking task as [x] completed
3. **IMMEDIATELY** commit the tasks.md update
4. **THEN AND ONLY THEN** start next task

### ⚠️ VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES ⚠️
**ANY DEVIATION FROM THIS WORKFLOW RESULTS IN IMMEDIATE SESSION TERMINATION**

**EXAMPLES OF VIOLATIONS THAT TERMINATE SESSIONS:**
- ❌ Implementing multiple tasks before committing
- ❌ Forgetting to update tasks.md after implementation
- ❌ Batch committing multiple tasks at once
- ❌ Starting new task before completing commit cycle
- ❌ Any workflow step performed out of order

**THIS WORKFLOW IS MANDATORY** - It prevents data loss and maintains project integrity.

## Active Technologies
- TypeScript 5.x / Node.js 20 LTS + React 18, Next.js 14, Prisma ORM, TanStack Query (001-family-finance-web)

## Commands
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run lint` - Run linting
- `npx jest tests/contract/test_*.ts --testMatch="**/test_*.ts"` - Run contract tests
- `npx ts-node tests/scripts/verify_tdd.ts` - Verify TDD compliance

- **Phase 4: Service Layer** ✅ COMPLETE (T145-T161) - All 17 services implemented and tested
- **Phase 5: API Implementation** ⏳ IN PROGRESS (T162-T298)
  - **Phase 5.1: Authentication Endpoints** ✅ COMPLETE (T162-T177, 16 endpoints)
  - **Phase 5.2: Family Management Endpoints** ✅ COMPLETE (T178-T189, 12 endpoints)
  - **Phase 5.3: Income Management Endpoints** ✅ COMPLETE (T190-T200, 11 endpoints)
  - **Phase 5.4: Payment Management Endpoints** ✅ COMPLETE (T201-T217d, 20 endpoints)
  - **Phase 5.5: Bank Integration Endpoints** ✅ COMPLETE (T218-T233, 16 endpoints)

  - **Phase 5.8: Infrastructure Endpoints** ✅ COMPLETE (T269-T272, 4 endpoints)
  - **Phase 5.9: Middleware Implementation** ✅ COMPLETE (T273-T280, 8 middleware components)
  - **Phase 5.10: Deployment Infrastructure** 🔄 PARTIAL (T281-T288 ✅, T289-T298 pending, 10 remaining)
- **Phase 6: Frontend Implementation** ⏳ PENDING (T297-T415)
- **Phase 7: Integration & Polish** ⏳ PENDING (T416-T475)

## Next Session Priorities
1. **COMPLETE T289-T298**: Finish remaining infrastructure (10 tasks: backup, monitoring, security config, etc.)
2. **BEGIN PHASE 6**: Frontend implementation (119 tasks: components, pages, state management)
3. **CRITICAL**: Every task MUST be committed immediately upon completion - ZERO TOLERANCE for violations
4. **MANDATORY**: Follow strict git workflow - implementation → commit → tasks.md update → commit → next task

## Code Style
TypeScript 5.x / Node.js 20 LTS: Follow standard conventions, no comments unless requested
