# spec-kit Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-09-25

## üö® CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT üö®
**NON-NEGOTIABLE**: After completing ANY task implementation:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** run `git add` and `git commit` with detailed message
2. **IMMEDIATELY** update tasks.md marking task as [x] completed
3. **IMMEDIATELY** commit the tasks.md update
4. **THEN AND ONLY THEN** start next task

### ‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES ‚ö†Ô∏è
**ANY DEVIATION FROM THIS WORKFLOW RESULTS IN IMMEDIATE SESSION TERMINATION**

**EXAMPLES OF VIOLATIONS THAT TERMINATE SESSIONS:**
- ‚ùå Implementing multiple tasks before committing
- ‚ùå Forgetting to update tasks.md after implementation
- ‚ùå Batch committing multiple tasks at once
- ‚ùå Starting new task before completing commit cycle
- ‚ùå Any workflow step performed out of order

**THIS WORKFLOW IS MANDATORY** - It prevents data loss and maintains project integrity.

### üìã NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES:
1. **üéØ UI TESTING & VALIDATION**: Comprehensive testing of all application routes and functionality
   - Landing page functionality verification
   - Navigation testing across all main routes (dashboard, income, payments, budget, calendar, reports, bank-accounts, family)
   - Error identification and resolution for any remaining 500 status routes
   - UI/UX consistency validation across all pages

2. **üß≠ EXPECTED STATUS**: All payment routes should now work (200 status) with newly implemented components
   - Server running on Next.js 14.2.15 + React 18 (stable)
   - React Query + ErrorBoundary + Analytics working
   - All Phase 6.5 Payment Management components now available

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è TESTING APPROACH**: Systematic validation of application functionality
   - Test each route for proper rendering and data loading
   - Verify component imports and dependencies are resolved
   - Identify any remaining missing components or styling issues
   - Document any performance issues or UX improvements needed

2. **‚úÖ Missing UI Components CREATED**:
   - `/frontend/src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Complete Button component with variants
   - `/frontend/src/components/ui/card.tsx` - Complete Card component system
   - `/frontend/src/components/ui/badge.tsx` - Badge component with variants
   - `/frontend/src/components/ui/tabs.tsx` - Tabs component system
   - Installed `class-variance-authority` package for styling variants

3. **‚úÖ React Query Setup FIXED**:
   - Created `/frontend/src/lib/react-query.tsx` with QueryProvider
   - Updated `/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` to wrap app with QueryProvider
   - Fixed "No QueryClient set" errors for bank-accounts and family pages

4. **‚úÖ Reports Route FIXED**:
   - ReportsDashboard component was trying to import missing Badge and Tabs components
   - Creating the UI components resolved the 500 errors

5. **‚úÖ Original Page Functionality RESTORED**:
   - Found backup files: `page-original.tsx` in budget/ and calendar/ directories
   - Restored full-featured budget and calendar pages from backups
   - Fixed import issues in restored calendar page

### Current Status:
- **Server**: Running on localhost:3001 (port 3000 in use)
- **Navigation**: ‚úÖ All 8 main routes working (200 status)
- **UI Components**: ‚úÖ Complete set of reusable components created
- **Data Fetching**: ‚úÖ React Query infrastructure working
- **Branding**: ‚úÖ KGiQ glassmorphic design intact

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SESSION STATUS: React Query Webpack Issues Identified (Sep 25, 2025)
**ISSUE FOUND**: TanStack React Query causing webpack module loading errors with Next.js 14.2.33

### What Was Discovered:
1. **üéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Next.js version severely outdated
   - Current: Next.js 14.2.33 (latest: 15.5.4) - major version behind
   - TanStack React Query (@tanstack/react-query@5.90.2) incompatible with Next.js 14.x webpack configuration
   - Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')" - webpack module loading failure

2. **‚úÖ TEMPORARY WORKAROUND**: Landing page working without QueryProvider
   - Removed all React Query components to isolate issue
   - Fixed CSS hydration by replacing custom properties with Tailwind classes
   - Landing page now loads successfully but no data fetching capability

3. **üìã COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED**: Systematic component isolation performed
   - ‚úÖ Basic layout + CSS imports: WORKING
   - ‚ùå Any QueryProvider usage: BREAKS webpack module loading
   - üîÑ ErrorBoundary, Analytics, SpeedInsights: UNTESTED (removed during troubleshooting)

### Current Status:
- **Landing Page**: ‚úÖ WORKING (without React Query)
- **Navigation**: ‚ùå UNKNOWN - other routes likely broken without QueryProvider
- **UI Styling**: ‚úÖ KGiQ branding and glassmorphic design working
- **Data Fetching**: ‚ùå BROKEN - all React Query functionality disabled
- **Server**: Running stable on localhost (ports 3000-3002 tested)

### üéØ CRITICAL NEXT STEP:
**UPGRADE NEXT.JS**: Version 14.2.33 ‚Üí 15.5.4 will likely resolve all React Query webpack issues

### üî∂ PERFORMANCE NOTE FOR FUTURE OPTIMIZATION:
**Issue**: Budget, Calendar, Bank, and Family pages take ~5 seconds to render
**Status**: Pages do render successfully with full functionality, but slower than ideal
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Not blocking for functionality testing, but should be optimized before production
**Likely Causes**: Large component trees, data fetching delays, or excessive re-renders
**Next Steps**: Performance profiling and optimization needed before production deployment

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking):
1. **React JSX type validation warnings** on Dashboard page - pages still render correctly
2. **Family page shows "no family settings found"** - expected behavior when no data is configured

### Files Changed This Session:
- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Removed QueryProvider, ErrorBoundary, Analytics (commented out with restoration notes)
- `frontend/next.config.js` - Added React Query webpack rules (ineffective)
- `TROUBLESHOOTING_SESSION_NOTES.md` - Comprehensive documentation of all testing and findings

### Session Impact:
- **Problem**: React Query webpack module loading errors preventing app startup
- **Root Cause**: Next.js 14.2.33 incompatible with React Query 5.90.2
- **Temporary Fix**: Disabled React Query to isolate and confirm the issue
- **Next Action**: Upgrade Next.js 14.x ‚Üí 15.5.4 should resolve all issues
