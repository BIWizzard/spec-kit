Bank data is securely encrypted and stored in our Neon PostgreSQL database.
We use TLS 1.3 for data in transit and AES-256 for data at rest. Access is
controlled through OAuth 2.0 authentication with MFA. We maintain comprehensive
audit logs and follow bank-grade security practices. Users can export or delete
their data at any time.

**Q: What security measures do you have in place?**
```
- HTTPS with HSTS enforcement and A+ SSL grade
- Complete OWASP security headers implementation
- Multi-factor authentication required for all users

- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Encrypted database with automatic backups
- Session management with automatic timeout
- Comprehensive audit logging of all data access
```

**Q: How do users benefit from your application?**
```
Families gain intelligent cash flow management through our unique income
attribution system. Users can link payments to specific paychecks, create
smart budgets with percentage allocation, and get real-time insights into
their financial health. The application helps paycheck-to-paycheck families
better plan their spending and avoid overdrafts through visual cash flow calendars.
```

**Q: Do you share data with third parties?**
```
No, we do not sell or share user data with third parties for marketing purposes.
Data is only shared with essential service providers (database hosting,
authentication, email delivery) under strict contractual protections.
Family members can share data within the application with controlled permissions.
