## Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies
- **Tests → Implementation**: All contract tests (T027-T131) and integration tests (T136-T144) MUST be completed and failing before any API implementation (T162-T278)
- **Database → Services**: Database models (T014-T026) must be complete before service layer (T145-T161)
- **Services → APIs**: Service layer (T145-T161) must be complete before API endpoints (T162-T278)
- **Infrastructure → Deployment**: Infrastructure setup (T279-T296) must be complete before production deployment
- **APIs → Frontend**: Backend APIs must be functional before frontend integration (T297-T415)
- **Core Frontend → Advanced**: Basic layout and auth (T297-T316) before advanced features (T317-T415)

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 488 (expanded from original 196)
**New Tasks Added**: 292 additional tasks for complete coverage
**Gap Analysis**: Two independent reviews achieved 100% completeness
**Quality Assurance**: Fixed duplicate T217 numbering issue

### Coverage Improvements:
- **Authentication**: Added 10 missing endpoints (password reset, MFA, sessions)
- **Reports & Analytics**: Added 15 missing endpoints (comprehensive reporting)
- **Bank Integration**: Added 10 missing endpoints (reconnection, categorization, Plaid)
- **Budget Management**: Added 8 missing endpoints (templates, projections, validation)
- **Payment Management**: Added 11 missing endpoints (spending categories, bulk operations)
- **Infrastructure**: Added 18 deployment and configuration tasks
- **Frontend**: Added 100+ components and pages for complete UI coverage
- **Testing**: Added 17 additional E2E tests and 12 unit test suites
- **Security & Performance**: Added 14 comprehensive audit tasks
- **Documentation**: Added 8 comprehensive documentation tasks

### Architecture Alignment:
- ✅ **Zero-Cost Stack**: Neon PostgreSQL + Vercel deployment
- ✅ **Modern Tech Stack**: Next.js 14 + Prisma + TanStack Query
- ✅ **Security First**: Comprehensive auth flows + MFA support
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Monitoring, logging, backup strategies
- ✅ **Developer Experience**: Complete documentation + setup automation

## Notes
- **[P] = Parallel**: Can run simultaneously with other [P] tasks
- **TDD Critical**: Contract tests MUST fail before implementation begins
- **File Conflicts**: Tasks modifying the same file cannot be parallel
- **Dependencies**: Respect the phase ordering for successful implementation
- **Commit Strategy**: Commit after each completed task for rollback capability
- **MVP Strategy**: Can implement in phases - Core features first (T001-T296), Advanced features later
- **Team Scaling**: [P] tasks enable multiple developers to work concurrently
- **Quality Gates**: Each phase has validation checkpoints before proceeding
