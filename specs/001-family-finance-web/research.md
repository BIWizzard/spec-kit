# Research Findings: Family Finance Web Application

## Bank Integration Services

### Decision: Plaid API
**Rationale**: Industry standard with broad bank coverage (12,000+ institutions), robust security, and reasonable pricing for MVP scale
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Yodlee: More expensive, complex implementation
- MX: Better analytics but higher cost barrier
- Direct bank APIs: Limited coverage, complex multi-integration maintenance
- Open Banking APIs: Limited to specific regions (UK/EU)

**Key Findings**:
- Plaid offers Production tier free up to 100 connected accounts
- Provides webhooks for transaction updates (better than polling)
- Handles MFA and bank-specific authentication flows
- Compliance: SOC 2 Type II, supports OAuth 2.0

## Frontend Architecture

### Decision: Next.js 14 with App Router
**Rationale**: Server components reduce bundle size, built-in optimization for Core Web Vitals, excellent mobile performance
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Create React App: No SSR/SSG, larger bundles
- Remix: Less mature ecosystem for fintech
- Vite + React: Requires manual optimization setup

**Key Patterns**:
- Server Components for initial page loads (reduces client JS)
- Client Components only for interactive elements (calendar, charts)
- Parallel data fetching with React Suspense boundaries
- Static generation for marketing pages

## State Management

### Decision: TanStack Query + Zustand
**Rationale**: TanStack Query handles server state with built-in caching, Zustand for lightweight client state
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux Toolkit: Overkill for MVP scope
- Context API only: Performance issues with frequent updates
- SWR: Less flexible than TanStack Query

## Database Architecture

### Decision: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
**Rationale**: ACID compliance crucial for financial data, Prisma provides type safety and migration management
**Alternatives Considered**:
- MongoDB: Eventual consistency problematic for financial transactions
- DynamoDB: Complex for relational data
- Raw SQL: Higher maintenance burden, prone to SQL injection

**Schema Patterns**:
- Double-entry bookkeeping pattern for transaction integrity
- Soft deletes for audit trail (never hard delete financial records)
- Optimistic locking for concurrent updates
- Materialized views for complex balance calculations

## Authentication Strategy

### Decision: NextAuth.js with PostgreSQL sessions
**Rationale**: Supports OAuth 2.0, free MFA implementation, database session management, CSRF protection
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Auth0: Ongoing costs, vendor lock-in
- Supabase Auth: Additional service complexity for single family
- Custom implementation: Security risk, time consuming

**Security Implementation**:
- Database sessions with secure HTTP-only cookies
- Session cleanup via PostgreSQL TTL
- MFA via TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) - custom implementation
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for family members via PostgreSQL RLS

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Decision: Mobile-first responsive design
**Rationale**: 60%+ users access financial apps via mobile, single codebase reduces maintenance
**Alternatives Considered**:
- React Native: Separate codebase, overkill for MVP
- PWA with offline: Complex sync logic
- Separate mobile site: Maintenance burden

**Implementation Strategy**:
- CSS Grid + Flexbox for layouts
- Touch-optimized interactions (48px tap targets)
- Viewport meta tag configuration
- Responsive images with next/image

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: TanStack Query + Vercel Edge caching
**Rationale**: Client-side caching reduces server load, Vercel Hobby tier sufficient for single family
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redis: Unnecessary complexity and cost for single family
- Self-hosted: Higher operational complexity
- No caching: Acceptable performance impact for single family scale

**Optimization Techniques**:
- TanStack Query aggressive client-side caching (5-10 minute stale times)
- Static generation for non-dynamic content
- Incremental Static Regeneration for semi-dynamic pages
- Database query optimization with indexes
- PostgreSQL materialized views for complex calculations

## Data Encryption

### Decision: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for transit
**Rationale**: Industry standard, FIPS 140-2 compliant, performant
**Alternatives Considered**:
- RSA only: Slower for large data sets
- Custom encryption: Security risk
- Database-level only: Insufficient for compliance

**Implementation Details**:
- Column-level encryption for PII
- Encrypted database backups
- Key rotation every 90 days
- HSM for key management in production

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Testing pyramid approach
**Rationale**: Balanced coverage with maintainable test suite
**Test Distribution**:
- 60% Unit tests (Jest, React Testing Library)
- 30% Integration tests (API endpoints, database)
- 10% E2E tests (Playwright for critical paths)

**Key Testing Patterns**:
- Fixture factories for test data
- Database transactions for test isolation
- Mock service worker for API mocking
- Visual regression testing for UI components

## Compliance Considerations

### Findings: MVP Compliance Requirements
- PCI DSS not required (no direct card processing via Plaid)
- GDPR considerations for EU users (future)
- SOC 2 Type I sufficient for MVP
- State money transmitter licenses not required (not holding funds)

## Cost Analysis

### MVP Infrastructure Costs (Monthly) - Single Family Deployment
- Vercel Hobby: $0 (100GB bandwidth, sufficient for 1 family)
- Neon PostgreSQL Free: $0 (3GB storage, ~60 years of transaction data)
- TanStack Query + PostgreSQL Sessions: $0 (no Redis needed)
- Plaid: $0 (up to 100 accounts, MVP uses 12 accounts)
- Resend Email: $0 (3,000 emails/month free tier)
- **Total**: $0/month for single family MVP

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling Strategy
- Stateless API design for easy scaling
- Database read replicas for query distribution
- Redis for session management (not in-memory)
- Queue system for background jobs (bank syncs)

## Development Timeline Estimation

### Based on Research and Scope
- **Phase 1**: Core data models and API (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Authentication and family management (1 week)
- **Phase 3**: Income/expense tracking (2 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Bank integration (2 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Calendar and visualizations (1 week)
- **Phase 6**: Testing and deployment (1 week)
- **Total**: ~9 weeks for MVP with single developer

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks and Mitigations
1. **Bank API changes**: Abstract integration layer, monitor changelogs
2. **Data breaches**: Encryption, security audits, penetration testing
3. **Performance degradation**: Monitoring, auto-scaling, caching
4. **Compliance changes**: Legal review, modular architecture
5. **User adoption**: Progressive onboarding, clear value proposition

## Next Steps
All technical unknowns have been resolved. Ready to proceed with Phase 1 design artifacts:
- Data model definition
- API contract generation
- Test scenario extraction
- Quickstart guide creation
