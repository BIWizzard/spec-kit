Post-Tasks Review Strategy

  Yes, definitely review the plan after /tasks completes for:

  1. Task-to-Design Gaps: Ensure generated tasks adequately cover all contracts and entities
  2. Implementation Sequence: Verify task dependencies make sense
  3. Missing Bridge Steps: Check if tasks clearly reference design artifacts
  4. Zero-Cost Architecture: Confirm tasks reflect the updated Neon/no-Redis architecture

  What to Check After /tasks

  - Are there tasks for each API contract?
  - Do database tasks follow the entity creation sequence?
  - Are test tasks properly linked to quickstart scenarios?
  - Does the task breakdown address the audit gaps I identified earlier?

  Recommended flow:
  1. New session â†’ /tasks
  2. Review generated tasks.md
  3. Ask me to audit the complete plan (all artifacts together)
  4. Identify any final gaps before implementation

  This approach will give you the most comprehensive task breakdown and catch any remaining disconnects between design and
  implementation.
