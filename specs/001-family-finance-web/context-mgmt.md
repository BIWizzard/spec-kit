ðŸ“Š Context Reality Check

  Your 488-task implementation will likely:
  - Generate ~500K+ tokens of code, tests, and configuration files
  - Create 100+ files across backend/frontend/tests directories
  - Produce extensive build logs and error messages
  - Accumulate git commit history and progress tracking

  ðŸ”„ Smart Session Management

  Recommended approach:
  Session 1: Phase 1-2 (Setup + Database) â†’ T001-T026
  Session 2: Phase 3.1-3.5 (Contract Tests 1) â†’ T027-T096a
  Session 3: Phase 3.6-4.2 (Contract Tests 2 + Services) â†’ T097-T161
  Session 4: Phase 5.1-5.5 (API Implementation 1) â†’ T162-T233
  Session 5: Phase 5.6-5.10 (API Implementation 2 + Infrastructure) â†’ T234-T296
  Session 6: Phase 6.1-6.5 (Frontend Core) â†’ T297-T344
  Session 7: Phase 6.6-6.10 (Frontend Advanced) â†’ T345-T415
  Session 8: Phase 7 (Testing + Polish) â†’ T416-T488

  ðŸŽ¯ Natural Breaking Points

  Phase boundaries are perfect:
  - After T026: Database setup complete, clean foundation
  - After T144: All contract tests done, ready for implementation
  - After T161: Services complete, ready for API endpoints
  - After T296: Backend + infrastructure complete, ready for frontend
  - After T415: Frontend complete, ready for final testing

  ðŸš€ Session Restart Benefits

  Fresh context gives you:
  - âœ… Faster responses - no accumulated context bloat
  - âœ… Better code quality - agent sees current state clearly
  - âœ… Cleaner file handling - no stale file references
  - âœ… Reduced token costs - start fresh without accumulated history

  ðŸ’¾ State Persistence

  What's preserved across sessions:
  - âœ… Git commits - all completed work
  - âœ… File system - all generated code
  - âœ… Progress tracking - tasks.md completion status
  - âœ… Configuration - .env files, package.json, etc.

  What resets:
  - ðŸ”„ Agent memory - fresh perspective on current state
  - ðŸ”„ Context window - clean slate for new work
  - ðŸ”„ File references - agent re-reads current files

  âš¡ Optimal Strategy

  1. Start /implement and let it run through a natural phase
  2. Monitor progress - watch for phase completion messages
  3. New session at phase boundaries - every ~60-80 tasks
  4. Resume with /implement - picks up automatically
  5. Expect 6-8 sessions total for complete implementation

  This approach balances implementation continuity with optimal performance! ðŸŽ¯
