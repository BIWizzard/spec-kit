## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors (families), actions (track, budget, schedule), data (income, expenses, payments), constraints (paycheck-to-paycheck)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)

   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: User Access Model - Single shared account or multiple family members with individual logins? → A: Multiple family members with individual logins, shared data visibility, and configurable permissions per member
- Q: Bank Transaction Sync Frequency - How often should transactions sync? → A: Daily scheduled sync with on-demand sync option per account or all accounts
- Q: Transaction History Retention - How long to keep imported transactions? → A: Never delete (unlimited retention)
- Q: Payment Conflict Resolution - How to handle payments exceeding income balance? → A: Allow payment up to available income, track remaining balance, support splitting across multiple income events (auto or manual)
- Q: MVP Security Baseline - What minimum security standard for financial data? → A: Industry standard (OAuth 2.0, MFA, encrypted storage)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a family managing finances paycheck-to-paycheck, I want to schedule and attribute bill payments directly to specific income events (paychecks), so I can clearly see how much money remains available from each paycheck for other expenses and avoid overdrafts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a $1000 paycheck scheduled for August 1st, **When** they schedule a $500 bill payment and attribute it to that paycheck, **Then** the system shows $500 remaining available from that income event

2. **Given** a user has set up a 50/30/20 budget allocation (Needs/Wants/Savings), **When** a $1000 income event is received, **Then** the system automatically splits available funds into $500 Needs, $300 Wants, and $200 Savings buckets

3. **Given** a user has connected their bank account, **When** the daily sync runs or user triggers manual sync, **Then** the system imports new transactions, categorizes spending, and updates running balances

4. **Given** a user views the calendar on August 15th, **When** they click on a specific day/week/month, **Then** they see a detailed tabular view of all income and scheduled payments for that period with running balance calculations

### Edge Cases
- When a scheduled payment exceeds the remaining balance from its attributed income event, system allows payment up to available amount and tracks remaining balance for splitting across other income events
- How does system handle when actual paycheck amount differs from scheduled amount?
- What occurs if bank connection is lost or transactions fail to sync?
- How are variable recurring payments (like utilities) handled when amount is unknown?
- What happens when user tries to schedule payments before income events?
- System handles split payments by allowing automatic or manual distribution across multiple income events with remaining balance tracking
